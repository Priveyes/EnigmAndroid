    <string name="title_about_dialog">About EnigmAndroid</string>
    <string name="description_text">EnigmAndroid is an implementation of a simulation of the Enigma Machine.
    The Enigma Machine is a cypher machine developed in the 1920s. It was used by the german Wehrmacht to
    encipher secret messaged during the second world war. For enciphering text, every letter is passed through 3 mechanical rotors that rotate with every keypress.
    That way the enigma achieves polyalphabetic substitution and the output appears random. The rotors could be chosen from a set of 5. Additionally there was a
    so called plugboard, where one could switch over pairs of letters.

    <string name="title_section_how_to_use">How to use</string>
    <string name="section_how_to_use">To encrypt/decrpyt a message, you can type it into the input field.
        Afterwards you can select a reflector and the three rotors. Also select their initial positions.
        Then you can set pairs on the plugboard. Therefore you just type the pairs separated by commas (e.g. \"ab,cd\").
        Notice that you can\'t plug a letter twice.
        Optionally you can set custom ring settings. Open the options menu and select \"Ringsettings\".
        When you are ready press \"En-/Decrypt!\".</string>
